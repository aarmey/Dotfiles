Acid hydrolysis
	*	 Papain digest and 12N HCL 1:1
	*	110 overnight in sealed glass ampules
	*	dry sample 24-48 h in vacuum-pump with NaOH
	*	resuspend in 1 ml assay buffer, vortex, overnight at 4, vortex again
	*	store at -20 or assay

Hydroxyproline assay
Reagents:
	*	stock buffer: 50 g citric acid monohydrate, 12 ml glacial acetic acid , 120 g sodium acetate trihydrate, 34 g sodium hydroxide ad 1 liter, pH 6.0, store at 4
	*	assay buffer: 1:10 dilution of stock buffer
	*	chloramin-T-reagent: 0.3525g Chloramine T dissolved in 5.175 ml water, add 6.5 ml m-propanol and 13.325 ml stock buffer, make fresh
	*	Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde reagent: 3.75 g dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 15 ml n-propanol, add 6.5 ml perchloric acid, make fresh
	*	Standard: 1 mg/ml hydroyxproline, store -20
Method:
	1.	standard dilutions: 0, 0 , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 ,10 =B5g/ml
	2.	sample dilutions: 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80,1: 100
	3.	200 {\textmu}l sample/standard in eppendorf
	4.	add 100 {\textmu}l Chloramine T, pipett mix 20 min room temp
	5.	add 100 {\textmu}l dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, pipet mix, 15 min 60 water bath
